1
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:15,599
Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammā

2
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:19,079
sambuddhassa I send greetings and best

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,320
wishes to everyone and I hope that

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:25,799
everybody in these very difficult and

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,359
critical times is keeping well peaceful

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,000
and content I want to offer for a few

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:38,780
minutes some reflections on how to

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,539
respond to the coronavirus crisis and

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,719
the first thing that has to be stated

10
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:48,269
and said we should be very very diligent

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,910
and scrupulous in observing the advice

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,329
given to us by the medical professionals

13
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,369
they have our best interest in mind and

14
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,370
even though some of the advice they give

15
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,429
might be difficult to follow but in

16
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:05,399
order to prevent the spread of the virus

17
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:09,049
we have to adhere very diligently very

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,350
conscientiously to their words of advice

19
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:17,490
the virus can spread very rapidly and

20
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:20,339
very widely if we are careless but if we

21
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:23,759
are careful and diligent then we can

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,700
gradually flatten the curve of the virus

23
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,938
that means a set of the virus increasing

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,540
shortly like this the virus will

25
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:36,298
increase gradually and slowly and then

26
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,320
the expansion rate of the virus will

27
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:44,280
flatten off and hopefully will drop

28
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:49,798
until the virus vanishes the virus

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:54,030
spreads not in a linear progression but

30
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,880
it spreads virally that is exponentially

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,899
from one person it could spread to three

32
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:03,718
from three to nine from nine to 27 and

33
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,450
so on and so we have to follow the

34
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:10,530
advice of the medical professionals in

35
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,670
order to curb to stop the spread of the

36
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,129
virus

37
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:16,829
and some of the main points that the

38
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,949
medical professionals teach us the first

39
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,440
is what is called social distancing

40
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:27,149
which means that we have to keep a

41
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:29,430
physical distance from other people the

42
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,789
natural tendency of the human mind is

43
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:37,200
for people to mix together to come close

44
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:43,109
together to shake hands when we meet to

45
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:45,839
hug to speak together intimately to

46
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,090
gather together in groups but if we

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,150
happen that way then we're going to

48
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:55,610
become agents for picking up the virus

49
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,519
ourselves and spreading it to others and

50
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:02,340
so to avoid that we have to observe

51
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,769
social distancing to keep a distance

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,860
from others not to join in group

53
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:12,030
activities not to go out to public the

54
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,970
public domain but to remain to the best

55
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:19,949
of our ability to remain at home to

56
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:23,280
remain in our room the second principle

57
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:25,560
which is taught by the medical

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,549
professionals is to frequently wash

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,289
one's hands and to wash them with soap

60
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:35,640
the reason we have to use soap is

61
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:37,889
because soap breaks up and destroys the

62
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,639
virus just washing with water is not

63
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,309
sufficient

64
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,250
so you soap and rub the hands together

65
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,340
to create a lather and rub them for

66
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:57,389
about 20 seconds before rinsing off the

67
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:59,250
hands so in following the advice of the

68
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,818
professionals the medical professionals

69
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,829
we're taking care firstly of ourselves

70
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:08,488
but by taking care of ourselves we're

71
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:11,280
also taking care of others we are

72
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:15,509
protecting ourselves from picking up the

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:19,228
virus and by avoiding the virus

74
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:22,949
ourselves we protect others because we

75
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:25,389
don't become a channel a vector for

76
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,639
spreading the virus to others

77
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:30,939
so it might seem that taking care of

78
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,550
ourselves is an act of selfishness but

79
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:37,840
actually this is a true act of

80
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:40,150
compassion a way to protect others and

81
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,598
there's a sutra spoken by the Buddha

82
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:46,299
which illustrates this in this Sutra

83
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:51,069
it's occurs in the Satipaṭṭhāna-saṃyuttaṃ

84
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:55,418
(Sedaka Sutta) it relates a story of two 

85
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:59,500
acrobats who come to a town one is the

86
00:04:55,418 --> 00:05:02,288
master the other is the disciple so they

87
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,620
come to the town and they set up the

88
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:09,250
pole the acrobatic pole and then the

89
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,340
master says to his disciple climb on my

90
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,089
shoulders the disciple climbs up on her

91
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:17,638
shoulders

92
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:21,418
then the master says you protect me and

93
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:24,579
I will protect you and then that way

94
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:27,609
protecting each other we can perform our

95
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:31,329
feats you'll get down safely from the

96
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,689
pole and we'll make some money but the

97
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:38,680
disciple says to the master master

98
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:42,968
that's not the right way to do it rather

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:46,209
you protect yourself I will protect

100
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:49,300
myself and when we are each protecting

101
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:53,468
ourselves then we will be safe and

102
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:57,069
secure in that way we can perform our

103
00:05:53,468 --> 00:06:00,449
feats I'll get down safely and we will

104
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:04,210
make our living and then the Buddha said

105
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:08,408
the advice given by the disciple that is

106
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:11,500
the correct way to perform the acrobatic

107
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:15,240
feet so the buddha applying this to our

108
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,218
everyday life he says in the same way

109
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,240
protect yourself and by protecting

110
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:23,918
yourself you'll also protect others and

111
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,658
by protecting others

112
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:32,049
you also protect yourself and so by

113
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:34,930
taking care of ourselves properly we'll

114
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:38,129
protect our family members of our

115
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:41,730
community members of our

116
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:48,540
city or town and people throughout the

117
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:49,770
country now when we face this virus face

118
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,460
this epidemic

119
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:57,089
many people get overcome by fear by

120
00:06:53,459 --> 00:07:00,659
worried by and even by anxiety even by a

121
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:04,439
mood of panic so how are we going to

122
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:07,800
deal with this crisis in terms of the

123
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:11,879
Dhamma how are we going to apply to

124
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,689
apply the Dharma to help us overcome our

125
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:21,360
fear or worry or concern and live in

126
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:25,680
peace and equanimity I want to mention

127
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,590
three different approaches each approach

128
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,920
will be more appropriate for people of a

129
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:34,919
different temperament one approach is

130
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,140
based on faith and devotion another

131
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,100
approach on mindfulness and

132
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:44,699
concentration of Samadhi and the third

133
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:47,610
approach is based on wisdom and insight

134
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:51,750
of course all three factors should be

135
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:54,060
interwoven faith mindfulness and wisdom

136
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:58,290
but different people will place emphasis

137
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:02,550
on different approaches so for those who

138
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:07,410
incline to faith and devotion a way to

139
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:11,610
keep the mind strong calm and joyful is

140
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:14,970
to call to mind the excellent qualities

141
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:18,689
the virtues of the objects of our faith

142
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:21,630
that is the truth the three jewels the

143
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:25,230
triple gem so he called to mind the

144
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:28,050
Buddha as they all enlightened one the

145
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:31,950
perfectly enlightened one the boundless

146
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:35,629
wisdom and great compassion we call to

147
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:38,819
mind the Dharma as the path of practice

148
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:42,029
the way that leads to liberation and

149
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,090
enlightenment and we call to mind the

150
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:48,720
Sangha this can be the community of the

151
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:51,810
liberated aura Hut's or the community of

152
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,110
the pure compassionate Bodhi

153
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:59,339
sathya's we bring them to mind and think

154
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:02,879
of their purity their wisdom their

155
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:07,170
compassion their practice and their vows

156
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:10,528
and so when we let the minds well on the

157
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:13,769
three jewels and you could choose any of

158
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:17,039
the jewels that you prefer Buddha Dharma

159
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:20,149
or Sangha this will give rise to a

160
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:24,269
feeling an inner feeling of trust of

161
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:27,149
confidence of quiet joy and of inner

162
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:32,750
strength which will help us keep calm

163
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:36,679
and peaceful in this tough time of crisis

164
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:40,620
the second approach emphasizes

165
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:44,159
mindfulness leading to greater inner

166
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,250
calm and concentration so if this

167
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:51,600
approach we sit down in our meditation

168
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,350
seat and we set up my mindfulness first

169
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,740
the mindfulness of the whole body

170
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:01,470
feeling the body as a whole you can scan

171
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,710
the body and feel the sensations of the

172
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,279
body you can feel the touch of your

173
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:13,080
buttocks against the seat the legs on

174
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:16,649
the ground or the feet on the ground and

175
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,889
then you can turn your attention to the

176
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:23,370
breath and be mindful when breathing in

177
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:26,100
be mindful of the in-breath when

178
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,850
breathing out be mindful of the

179
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,850
out-breath and when thoughts arise

180
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:35,250
thoughts of worry thoughts of fear

181
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:38,879
thoughts of planning thoughts of anger

182
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:42,629
or thoughts of resentment whatever

183
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:47,370
thoughts arise you can just briefly note

184
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:51,509
that God let the thought come we'll let

185
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:56,159
it go drop the thought and bring the

186
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:59,639
mind back to the main object coming back

187
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:02,860
to the feeling of the body and then

188
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,779
moving from the body back to the breath

189
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,440
and if any of these feelings of fear

190
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:11,589
worry anxiety becomes very strong then

191
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,690
you can drop the breath and just focus

192
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,600
on the thought itself turning the

193
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,140
thought into an object or you can focus

194
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,050
on the sensations in the body as that

195
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:26,919
thought is running through the mind

196
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:30,639
feeling the tightness the clenching the

197
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:33,729
tension in the body and then using your

198
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:37,480
mind's you can relax the tension of the

199
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:39,759
body and when you feel ready then you

200
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,649
can bring the mind back to the breath

201
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,950
and in this way

202
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:50,049
whatever happens outwardly you remain

203
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:55,500
centered inwardly calm peaceful with

204
00:11:50,049 --> 00:12:00,399
equanimity the third approach is to use

205
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:05,080
wisdom or wise reflection —yoniso manasikāra

206
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:07,860
as a way as a way to deal with

207
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:12,940
the crisis brought on by the virus and

208
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:16,529
so with why is reflection we consider

209
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:20,190
that the virus is something of a teacher

210
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:23,319
teaching us the real nature of life

211
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:27,370
usually in our day to day life we always

212
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:30,460
continue our activities on the tacit

213
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,990
assumption that everything will go on

214
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:38,200
normally without any any disruption we

215
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,669
think we're always safe and secure but

216
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,460
what the Buddha teaches is that

217
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:46,079
underneath the peaceful surface of our

218
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:50,080
everyday life there are always dangers

219
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,840
hiding in the background and so now with

220
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:57,550
the virus these dangers have come out

221
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:59,590
from hiding into the open and so some of

222
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:03,490
the themes that the Buddha teaches his

223
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:08,740
disciples for daily reflection is to

224
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:11,860
reflect I am subject to old age I have

225
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:15,340
not escaped from old age

226
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:19,240
I am subject to illness I have not

227
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:23,139
escaped illness I am subject to death

228
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:27,070
I have not escaped death so we've picked

229
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:30,309
up this physical body at our birth we've

230
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,990
come into this world and having a body

231
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:36,369
living in this world

232
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:41,740
we're subject to aging subject to

233
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:44,950
illness subject to death and now as this

234
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,850
virus spreads we are facing the

235
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:52,090
realities particularly of illness and

236
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:55,720
the potential for death and so we have

237
00:13:52,090 --> 00:14:00,190
to keep our mind strong have to keep the

238
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:03,610
mind prepared a fourth topic that the

239
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,570
Buddha teaches for reflection is that I

240
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:11,350
must be parted and separated from

241
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:14,170
everyone that I love so even if we

242
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:18,399
continue to live if we don't die

243
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:22,389
ourselves our loved ones our relatives

244
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:25,750
our friends are also subject to death so

245
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:29,110
they might pass away before we do and if

246
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,840
we are not inwardly prepared then when

247
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,430
they pass away we become overcome by

248
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,889
grief and by misery even by depression

249
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:41,620
but if we consider this theme reflect on

250
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:44,590
this theme when our loved ones fall ill

251
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:48,370
and pass away and of course we feel

252
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:52,389
sorrow what we can maintain our strength

253
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:56,980
or tranquility through that sorrow and

254
00:14:52,389 --> 00:15:02,379
come out stronger ready to face the

255
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:06,460
challenges of life the fifth theme that

256
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:09,789
the Buddha teaches is that when we pass

257
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:12,940
away all that we take with us when we

258
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:16,480
move on to the next life is our Karma

259
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:19,540
the legacy of our good deeds and our bad

260
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,529
deeds and so if we bring this theme to

261
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:25,149
mind we say that we should right now

262
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:30,600
begin to perform good

263
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:33,689
NEADS especially by giving in charity to

264
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,659
organizations and are helping to address

265
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:40,510
the crisis of the virus to medical

266
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:43,839
organizations health care organizations

267
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:47,110
food distribution centers and so forth

268
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:51,879
that are helping people affected by the

269
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:56,680
virus and so we can choose whatever

270
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:59,679
approach we prefer the approach of faith

271
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:04,029
and devotion the approach of mindfulness

272
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:07,269
and concentration the approach of wisdom

273
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:12,669
of wise reflection in order to keep our

274
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:16,449
mind calm tranquil inwardly strong able

275
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:20,019
to face the crisis with courage and when

276
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:23,860
we have a calm strong courageous mind

277
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:26,409
that will boost the immune system so

278
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,070
that we become less vulnerable to the

279
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:34,329
virus if we're exposed to this but I

280
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:38,650
hope that everybody who listens to this

281
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:42,520
recording will be safe and secure be

282
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:46,059
peaceful and happy and that in no short

283
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,279
time in no long time the medical

284
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:51,369
profession will find the vaccine that

285
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:55,059
can eliminate the virus and so we can

286
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:59,529
return to our everyday life and so I

287
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:02,379
want to end this little series of

288
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:05,289
reflections by reciting some verses of

289
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:08,259
blessing calling upon the spiritual

290
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:12,609
power of the three jewels to protect

291
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:15,599
everybody who listens so these are

292
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:18,669
verses in the ancient pali language

293
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:22,689
wishing that you all be free from

294
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:25,720
illness that you enjoy a long lifespan

295
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:28,029
and that by the blessings of the buddha

296
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,610
the dhamma and the sangha and with the

297
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:34,710
protection of the deities you'll all be

298
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:34,709
safe and healthy

299
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,288

healthy and may we all come out from

313
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,270
this crisis from this epidemic stronger

314
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:44,630
with a greater sense of personal

315
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:47,778
responsibility for each other with

316
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:51,049
hearts full of loving-kindness and

317
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:55,038
compassion determined to work to create

318
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:59,148
a community a society a world in which

319
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:01,929
everyone can flourish and realize their

320
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:01,928
virtuous aspirations
