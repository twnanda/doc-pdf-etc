1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,869
Namo tassa bhagavato arahato

2
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:18,600
sammāsambuddhassa good morning everybody I'm

3
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:22,559
recording this little talk from Swami

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:27,060
and monastery in Carmel New York and it

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:31,559
is today is the morning of March 29th

6
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:35,659
I made a recording of some reflections

7
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:42,000
on the coronavirus about a week ago on

8
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:45,390
March 23rd and so now six more days have

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,119
gone by and according to the statistics

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,198
that I gathered this morning at present

11
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:55,878
globally there have been six hundred and

12
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:59,849
sixty thousand cases of reported

13
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:03,439
infections with the virus and thirty

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,700
thousand reported deaths from the virus

15
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,000
and I have to emphasize that these are

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,270
reported or recorded cases there can be

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,118
many more cases of people infected which

18
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:19,140
have not been reported confirmed and

19
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:21,688
recorded here in the United States

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,118
according to the figures I collected

21
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:28,679
they've been approximately a hundred

22
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:31,618
twenty thousand infections and two

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,600
thousand deaths the number of deaths has

24
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:39,629
doubled over the past couple of days in

25
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:43,679
the New York area in new actually in New

26
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:48,030
York City there have been 52,000 cases

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,470
of infection reported and approximately

28
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,269
800 deaths

29
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:55,420
the country with the greatest number of

30
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:59,829
deaths so far is Italy which has

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:03,219
recorded 10,000 deaths and when we look

32
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:05,620
at these figures and we could see how

33
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:08,770
cases of infection are spreading all

34
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:12,730
around us even amongst people who were

35
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:15,159
famous prominent powerful eminent people

36
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:17,829
who never thought they would be infected

37
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:22,270
then our own minds might be always

38
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:26,230
constantly overcome by fear by worry by

39
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:28,780
anxiety what should happen if I get

40
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:32,310
infected and this fear is quite

41
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,909
justified it's not in a rational fear

42
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:40,780
because the virus spreads almost an

43
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:42,819
invisible imperceptible ways and though

44
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,590
there are measures that we can adopt

45
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:47,379
measures that are recommended by the

46
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,289
various institutes of health by the

47
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:53,650
medical professionals methods that we

48
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:56,679
can adopt to protect ourselves from

49
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,780
infection by the virus no method is

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,670
absolutely foolproof

51
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,930
there's no in vulnerably we can't

52
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:08,738
guarantee that we'll be completely

53
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:12,700
invulnerable to the virus in fact this

54
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:15,069
past week one day this past week while I

55
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:18,909
was taking a walk around the monastery

56
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:21,519
I saw a parcel that the post had thrown

57
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:24,579
over the gate and I picked up that

58
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,620
parcel and brought it to the person for

59
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,750
whom it was intended and after I did

60
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,849
that suddenly the fear came over me I

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,689
picked up the parcel with my bare hands

62
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:36,729
that what if that parcel had been

63
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:40,209
infected with the virus what if it was

64
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:43,090
carrying the virus perhaps I too would

65
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,370
have been infected without knowing it

66
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,519
and I expected any day I would start to

67
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,459
get symptoms from the virus and so they

68
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,129
came over me as fear even almost some

69
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:57,729
degree of panic but here I am in

70
00:03:54,129 --> 00:04:00,490
relatively secluded conditions I get

71
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:04,329
infected with the virus and maybe if the

72
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:07,960
virus the disease starts to advanced

73
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,300
very quickly within a day or two the

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,580
obituary obituary for bhikkhu bodhi

75
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:19,060
appears on some of the websites the

76
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:20,799
buddhist websites fortunately that

77
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,319
hasn't happened and I haven't felt any

78
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:27,579
symptoms but that was a very real

79
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:30,670
possibility okay so I want to give some

80
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:34,719
thought some reflections about how do we

81
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:38,740
deal with fear the fear and anxiety that

82
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,830
can arise over the thought I might pick

83
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,920
up the virus or maybe I'm feeling a

84
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:46,659
little bit strange today maybe I have

85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,240
picked up the virus and maybe it's

86
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,720
starting to germinate and to spread

87
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,569
within my system as I said this can be a

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,010
very real fear and though there are some

89
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:59,680
people who say that one shouldn't

90
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:05,409
experience any fear at all I think it's

91
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:08,709
quite legitimate that one feels an

92
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:12,040
initial wave of fear and worry and

93
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:14,139
concern when if one starts to feel

94
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,140
symptoms or when one considers the

95
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:20,519
possibility that one might pick up the

96
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:24,219
infection what one has to do is to

97
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:27,449
prevent the fear that arises from

98
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,190
overpowering the mind and from

99
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:33,819
incapacitating the mind and so one of

100
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:38,469
the remedies the means for dealing with

101
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:42,639
the fear that might arise is to settle

102
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:46,450
down and not feel immediately compelled

103
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,349
to go into action when fear arises but

104
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:54,159
first settle down and reflect back upon

105
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:58,600
oneself using that great Buddhist

106
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:02,380
function called mindfulness so if fear

107
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:07,180
arises one could go to one's accustom

108
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:10,120
meditation seat and just sit down not

109
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,579
resolving on a long meditation but just

110
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,288
resolving to sit quietly for five

111
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:17,990
minutes 10 minutes

112
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:21,709
just to settle the mind and to

113
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:26,119
experience the body more clearly and

114
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:29,388
more intimately because it can be that

115
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:33,259
the unusual feelings that what is

116
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:36,019
experiencing in the body different mood

117
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,399
different sensations in the body that

118
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:39,978
these are things which are being

119
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:43,129
manufactured by the mind out of that

120
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:46,878
deeply embedded fear and worry about

121
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:50,330
picking up the virus so settle down and

122
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,849
get a sense of the body what I call a

123
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:57,468
global a total istic sense of the body

124
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:59,718
and then raise the question am I really

125
00:06:57,468 --> 00:07:03,468
experiencing something different

126
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:10,838
or is this just something which is being

127
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:13,939
conjured up by my imagination and then

128
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:16,819
if one can confirm that one is feeling

129
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,399
something different in the body once

130
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,860
you'd check these strange sensations the

131
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:25,069
unusual sensations one is experiencing

132
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:30,019
check them against the list of these

133
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:33,680
symptoms of the Cova virus or the corona

134
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:36,259
virus of the Covey's illness to say

135
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,629
whether they correspond because for

136
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:43,459
example if you are getting a sore throat

137
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:47,059
and your nose is running and you're

138
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:49,459
blowing into the handkerchief it's very

139
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:51,949
unlikely that that is the coal feed

140
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:54,619
illness because the way I've seen it on

141
00:07:51,949 --> 00:08:00,889
the websites the signs the typical signs

142
00:07:54,619 --> 00:08:05,509
of the Coheed illness would be a dry

143
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:09,288
cough and tightness or constriction in

144
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:12,110
the lungs but don't take my word for it

145
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:14,748
but go to one of the websites probably

146
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:18,110
the best source with for Americans would

147
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:21,999
be the website of the Center for Disease

148
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:24,709
Control CDC or John Hopkins University

149
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:27,709
or any of the other there are many many

150
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:28,750
websites which are now listing the

151
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:34,990
symptoms

152
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:37,299
of the co vide 19 and so if your

153
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,240
symptoms don't correspond to those on

154
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:43,658
the list then you can relax you might

155
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,210
have simple simply a cold or a ordinary

156
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:48,939
case of the flu and in that case take

157
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:53,019
the appropriate remedies for a cold or a

158
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:56,410
flu if your symptoms correspond to those

159
00:08:53,019 --> 00:09:00,250
of the Co vide virus and you should

160
00:08:56,409 --> 00:09:03,819
follow the advice given on the websites

161
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,679
the health websites I'm not a health

162
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:12,070
specialist so I'm not going to recommend

163
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:14,769
anything but what I could do as a

164
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,470
buddhist as a buddhist monk this give

165
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:21,429
some advice on how to deal with the fear

166
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:24,460
and worry that arise within the mind and

167
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:28,000
what one wants to do is keep i would

168
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:30,960
call this a healthy dose of fear taking

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,600
the sense or turning that fear into

170
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,180
concern and the motivation to take the

171
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,519
right course of action but not letting

172
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:45,219
the fear intensify duplicate multiply

173
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,210
proliferate and overwhelm the fear so

174
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,910
that one becomes paralyzed with fear

175
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:55,480
incapacitated blocked and impeded from

176
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:57,600
taking effective action when doesn't

177
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:02,110
want the fear to become something which

178
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,710
immobilizes the mind so for those who

179
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:09,779
are following the Buddha Dharma but I

180
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:12,639
would recommend is a method which is

181
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:16,990
suggested in a suitor a discourse of the

182
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:20,110
Buddha that occurs in the Sun Mutiny kya

183
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:26,110
the connected discourses and this occurs

184
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:27,519
in the chapter it's chapter 11 of the

185
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,399
Samyukta nakiya

186
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:34,120
is called the sakura-san yuta the

187
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,990
connected discourses with Saku Saku is

188
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:42,870
the ruler of the tava things of Davis

189
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,870
and this is suta number 3

190
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:56,089
call the DA jogger suta the crest of the

191
00:10:49,600 --> 00:11:00,080
standard that's a crest that is placed

192
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:03,170
on the banner that whirring factions

193
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,620
factions of warriors would carry into

194
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:09,219
battle against their opponents and in

195
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,139
the suitor the Buddha has described a

196
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,830
battle that takes place we call between

197
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:20,799
the davises the good deities and the

198
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:25,700
Asura's who are the demons the anti gods

199
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:29,479
and when this battle takes place

200
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:32,839
sokka the king of the gods tells the

201
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:37,550
Devas that when you are engaged in this

202
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:40,520
battle if fear or anxiety should arise

203
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:43,939
in you then you should look up at the

204
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,490
crest on the top of my banner and when

205
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,240
you look up at that crest and you'll say

206
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:54,709
that I am present leading the battle and

207
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:58,009
then your fear worry and anxiety will be

208
00:11:54,708 --> 00:12:00,619
abandoned and then he mentions some

209
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:04,069
other ways that the deities could dispel

210
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,879
their fear then he applies this to the

211
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:10,730
case of the monks who go into the forest

212
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:13,730
or to a deserted place to practice

213
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:16,970
meditation and sometimes when they go

214
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:22,100
all alone into these isolated places a

215
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:23,690
dark forest fear and anxiety can arise

216
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,050
in them with the thought that there

217
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:30,620
might be demons in this forest of wild

218
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:33,769
animals or malicious spirits of some

219
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:38,060
sort and so then the Buddha says when

220
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:42,230
that happens then you should call to

221
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:46,250
mind myself the Buddha himself calling

222
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:49,610
to mind that I the Buddha is one who is

223
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:53,059
perfectly enlightened the blessed one

224
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:55,329
the fully enlightened one and when you

225
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:59,618
think about me

226
00:12:55,328 --> 00:13:02,469
then your fear terror and anxiety will

227
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:06,129
be dispersed if you don't think of me

228
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:09,149
then you can think of the Dhamma call to

229
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:13,778
mind the Dhamma which is well expounded

230
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:17,589
directly visible immediate something to

231
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:19,480
be personally realized by the wise and

232
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:22,119
if you don't think of me

233
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,480
you don't think of the Dhamma think of the

234
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:28,298
Sangha the community of noble disciples

235
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:34,480
think of how the community of disciples

236
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:40,629
is endowed with great virtues of wisdom

237
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:43,928
compassion purity patience diligence and

238
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:48,399
so forth and then with reverence and

239
00:13:43,928 --> 00:13:51,249
veneration bringing to mind the Sangha

240
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,610
of noble disciples the great field of

241
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:59,290
merit for the world your fear and worry

242
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:01,149
and anxiety will be dispelled so that is

243
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,578
the advice that the Buddha gives to

244
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:06,789
monks who have gone into seclusion to

245
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:09,308
practice meditation and we ourselves can

246
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:14,498
use these reflections these

247
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:19,269
contemplations in order to allay to

248
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:22,989
dispel our own obsessive fear in anxiety

249
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:25,928
so you can bring to mind the figure of

250
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:28,600
the Buddha you can use an image or

251
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:32,110
picture of the Buddha bring it to mind

252
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,619
and think I have taken refuge in the

253
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,470
Buddha the perfectly enlightened one the

254
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:42,759
one endowed with boundless wisdom and

255
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:45,749
great compassion or you can call to mind

256
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:51,100
the Dhamma the well expounded path

257
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:54,579
leading to perfect wisdom and to

258
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,909
liberation or call to mind the Sangha

259
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:59,498
the community of great era Hut's

260
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:03,399
including such monks as Sāriputta

261
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:06,730
Moggallāna, Mahākassapa, Ānanda, and so

262
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,370
forth and think of the virtues of the

263
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,278
discipline

264
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:14,310
samadhi and wisdom and liberation of

265
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:19,909
those great monks and that will help

266
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:23,129
your fear and anxiety to be dispelled I

267
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:26,189
want to emphasize that doing these

268
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:30,350
reflections these contemplations is not

269
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:35,100
a substitute for obtaining proper

270
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:37,350
medical advice it's not an alternative

271
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,759
to consulting with the healthcare

272
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:45,330
professionals but rather it's a way of

273
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:48,330
temporarily alleviating relieving the

274
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:53,339
fear and worry that might arise in your

275
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:57,389
mind and so once you dispel and quiet

276
00:15:53,339 --> 00:16:00,600
down this fear worry and anxiety then

277
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:03,720
you should take the action recommended

278
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,830
by the health experts and I will try to

279
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,230
attach to this recording some of the

280
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:13,740
websites that you could turn to for

281
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:17,940
professional advice so I want to end by

282
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:22,889
expressing my wish my hope that all of

283
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:29,580
you who are listening will be free from

284
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:32,250
illness free from affliction free from

285
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,310
the coronavirus and from every other

286
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,490
kind of illness but if you should be

287
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:40,379
infected by the virus

288
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:43,639
I give my blessings that you

289
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:47,070
will be quickly recover from the illness

290
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:51,000
regain your strength and your health and

291
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:53,430
in any case I hope that all of you will

292
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,450
be free from what I call the obsessive

293
00:16:53,429 --> 00:17:01,259
and incapacitating type of fear but you

294
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:04,110
should use that healthy degree of fear

295
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:06,900
to take proper precautions as

296
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,659
recommended by the health experts to

297
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,870
protect yourself as well as possible

298
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,170
from infection by the virus so let me

299
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:19,818
end with extending the blessings of the

300
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,818
three jewels to all of you

301
